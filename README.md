# Accident_Prediction
Predicting Accidents using Historical data
In this analysis we want to study (descriptive analysis):
      1.	Which of the two conditions (lighting or weather) had a serious impact on the accidents?
      2.	What are the regions or areas with the most frequent accidents?
Predictive question: 
1.	Can we predict these incidents in advance to aid the general public and the other interested parties?
Prescriptive question:
1.	What steps should be taken by the ministry of transportation and traffic authorities to prevent or minimize the road accident?
